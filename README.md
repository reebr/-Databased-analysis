📊 Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of data analysis projects!
This repository showcases my work in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling using Python.
Each project represents a key step in the data analysis workflow — from raw data to insights and predictions.

🧩 Projects Overview
🔄 Data Analysis Pipeline (A1–A4)

A complete mini–project demonstrating the full data analysis workflow in Python.

Stages Included:

Data Cleaning & Preparation (A1) — handling missing values, converting data types, and preparing features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (A2) — generating statistics, visualizing distributions, and identifying correlations.

Relative Frequency Analysis (A3) — exploring data distributions and categorical frequencies.

Predictive Modeling (A4) — building and evaluating regression models using Scikit-learn.

Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction

Complete end-to-end project predicting property prices.
Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model tuning, and visualization of market trends.
Achieved strong predictive accuracy using regression algorithms.

Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

🧮 Statistical Methods – Lab Assignment 2

Description:
Practical assignment applying simple and multiple linear regression using built-in datasets (ChickWeight, women) and a provided dataset (fish.csv) — all analyzed and modeled in Python.

Key Tasks:

Compute the coefficient of determination (R²) for the ChickWeight dataset.

Test whether there is a significant relationship between variables at a 0.05 significance level.

Build a simple linear regression to predict Weight from Height in the women dataset.

Apply a multiple linear regression model on fish.csv to predict fish weights based on length and body measurements.
