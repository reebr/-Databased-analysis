# 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of data analysis projects!  
This repository includes various Python scripts and applied projects that demonstrate my skills in **data cleaning**, **visualization**, and **machine learning modeling**.  

Each file or project represents a stage in the typical data analysis workflow — from raw data exploration to predictive modeling.

## 🧩 Projects Overview

### 🧼 A1.py — Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Loads and explores raw datasets.  
- Handles missing values and inconsistent data.  
- Converts data types and prepares features for analysis.  
- Ensures the dataset is ready for modeling and visualization.

---

### 📈 A2.py — Data Exploration & Visualization
- Generates descriptive statistics and correlation matrices.  
- Visualizes data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- Highlights relationships, distributions, and trends.  
- Supports insight discovery and feature understanding.

---

### 🤖 A4.py — Predictive Modeling
- Builds regression models (e.g., linear or LASSO regression).  
- Splits data into training and testing sets.  
- Evaluates performance metrics (R², MAE, etc.).  
- Extracts insights to guide decision-making.
